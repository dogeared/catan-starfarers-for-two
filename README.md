# Catan: Starfarers - For Two Players v0.1

[Forget the preamble, take me to the rules](#the-rules)

I've been playing Settlers of Catan (now just Catan) since 2007. I've played and own a number of variants and expansions. I've documented this at the bottom of this post. I've played hundreds of hours both IRL and in the app.

My new favorite variant is [Catan: Starfarers](https://www.catan.com/starfarers). It has some new and interesting game dynamics: encounters, space travel, motherships that can be upgraded and much more. And, it still has a lot of the OG Catan dynamics: rolling dice, gathering resources, trading, building and getting points.

My wife and I play a lot of games together. We seek out good games for two as well as games for more than two that play well with two.

I got Catan: Starfarers as a present and I was so excited to play! I was disheartened to learn that it's minimum three players! Argh - I hate that.

My wife and I created a way to play with two people. We set up the game as usual for three players. The third player is an NPC - non-player character.

What follows below are the rules we came up with. I'm creating this as a GitHub repo so the rules can be versioned and updated over time.

## The Rules

**NOTE**: This assumes you are already familiar with the basic rules of Catan: Starfarers. You can find the rules [here](https://www.catan.com/sites/default/files/2021-06/catan_starfarers_rulebook_eng_190823s_0_0.pdf).

Over the course of the game, the players will play as the NPC. Let's call our two human players Alice and Bob. Follow these steps to play.

### Overview

This list of rules applies generally throughout the game.

1. A player in control of the NPC must always act in the best interest of the NPC.
2. Decide how to handle random binary outcome decisions. This can be done with a coin (for instance: heads, Alice wins; tails, Bob wins) or by using one of the dice in the game (for instance, on a roll of 1-3 Alice wins; on a roll of 4-6 Bob wins)
3. If there is an equal advantage in aggression toward the two real players or the other two players have the same offer in a trade with the NPC on the table, the outcome is determined randomly.

   Example: The NPC offers a `food` and wants a `fuel` resource. Both Alice and Bob agree to the trade. Alice (who is currently in control of the NPC) rolls a 2 and therefore gives her `fuel` card to the NPC and takes the NPC's `food` card (per the example established in #2 above).

4. Trades with the NPC - whether initiated by the NPC or with a player must be reasonable. What constitutes a trade being reasonable should be agreed on by the players for each trade.

   Example: A `good` is a more valuable resource since it can be traded with the supply 2:1. Alice and Bob agree that it's reasonable for the NPC give a `food` and a `carbon` for one `good`.

5. The NPC's resource cards should be face down except when they need to be viewed by the player controlling the NPC. Each time the resource cards are viewed by a player, they should be shuffled and placed face down again.

### Set Up

1. Set up for a three player game as normal.
2. Determine who will go first as normal. This could be the NPC.
3. Use some sort of marker to indicate which player is currently in control of the NPC.

### Game Play

**For the purposes of this demonstration of the rules, We'll have Alice go first, then the NPC, then Bob. Alice is in control of the NPC first.**

**Alice's Turn**:

1. Production Phase. After the dice are rolled, resources are gathered as normal. If the NPC is to receive resources, Alice (currently in control of the NPC) places the resources face down by the NPC. The NPC's pile of resource cards are then shuffled. Alice takes additional resource cards from the reserve pile as normal, depending on her score.

2. Trade & Build Phase. If Alice offers resources to trade with other players, Bob in addition to deciding on whether or not her wants to make the trade, examines the NPC's resource cards and determines if the NPC will participate in the trade. **NOTE**: Even though Alice is currently in control of the NPC, the opposite player - Bob - will resolve the trade for the NPC. Bob must keep in mind to operate in the NPC's best interests. Alice decides which trade whe will take if there's more than one.

   Example: Alice offers an `ore` and wants a `carbon`. Bob looks at his resources and indicates he's interested in the trade. Bob then looks at the NPC's resources. The NPC has multiple `carbon` resource cards and no `ore` resource cards. Bob determines that the NPC will accept the offer as well. Alice decides to accept the trade with the NPC.

3. Flight Phase. If there's to be an encounter, resolve it as normal. If the NPC would be involved, Bob will take the role of the NPC in the same way he did during the trade.

**NPC's Turn**:

1. Production Phase. Alice rolls the dice on behalf of the NPC. Resources are gathered as normal. Again, if the NPC is to receive resources, Alice places the resources face down by the NPC. The NPC's pile of resource cards are then shuffled. Alice draws additional resource cards from the reserve pile as normal according to the NPC's score.

2. Trade & Build Phase. Alice examines the NPC's resource cards and decides on what - if anything - to trade - either with players or the supply. Alice also decides on what - if anything - to build. The NPC should be played as you would play when you're in control of it. Resolve building as normal. That is, place trade ships, colony ships and/or spaceports as normal. Place cannons, freight pods and boosters on the NPC's mothership as normal.

3. Flight Phase. Alice shakes the NPC's mothership and resolves the outcome as normal. If there's to be an encounter, Bob reads the encounter card to Alice. Although Alice is acting on behalf of the NPC, she may still be involved in the encounter.

   Example: Alice shakes the NPC's ship and a black ball and a yellow ball are showing. Bob draws an encounter card. The card has a binary choice on it. Bob rolls a die. On a 1-3, the NPC answers, "Yes". On a 4-6, the NPC answers, "No". Bob rolls a 2. Therefore, the NPC says, "Yes". The card calls for the NPC and the player to the right of the NPC to shake their motherships and compare the outcome for speed. Alice shakes both her mothership and the NPC's mothership and determines who wins on speed (value of the blass based on color + boosters).

4. At the end of the NPC's turn, Alice passes the marker for who is in control of the NPC to Bob.

## Variations

1. Players can decide at the beginning of the game that when the NPC makes trades, the person in control of the NPC cannot participate in the trade.
2. When there's a binary choice for the NPC, the player in control of the NPC can decide which course to take rather than rolling a die. The player making this decision must always act in the best interest of the NPC.
